            <h1>J. Robert Oppenheimer</h1>
            <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) was an American theoretical physicist best known for his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II as part of the <strong>Manhattan Project</strong>, the U.S. research initiative to develop nuclear weapons. Often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb," his leadership at the <strong>Los Alamos Laboratory</strong> was critical in designing and constructing the world's first nuclear weapons.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Born in <strong>New York City</strong> to a wealthy Jewish family.</li>
                <li>Excelled academically, studying at <strong>Harvard University</strong>, the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong>, and receiving his doctorate from <strong>Göttingen University</strong> in Germany.</li>
                <li>His research spanned quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics.</li>

            <h2>Manhattan Project and the Bomb</h2>
            <p>In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed scientific director of the Manhattan Project. At <strong>Los Alamos</strong>, he oversaw the collaboration of some of the 20th century's greatest minds in physics, engineering, and chemistry.</p>
            <p>The first successful test of a nuclear bomb, <strong>Trinity</strong>, occurred on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico. Following the bombings of <strong>Hiroshima</strong> and <strong>Nagasaki</strong> in August 1945, Oppenheimer became a prominent but controversial figure. He reportedly remarked after the Trinity test, quoting the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>:</p>
            <blockquote>"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."</blockquote>

            <h2>Post-War Years</h2>
            <p>Oppenheimer became an advocate for international control of nuclear weapons, which led to tension with government officials during the early 
                Cold War. In 1954, during the <strong>Red Scare</strong>, his security clearance was revoked after a highly publicized hearing where he was accused of communist 
                sympathies and being a security risk, despite no conclusive evidence. This effectively ended his influence in government science policy.  <i>Here, I can change the past!</ii></p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Oppenheimer spent his later years as a professor and lecturer, reflecting on the moral implications of his work. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded him the <strong>Enrico Fermi Award</strong>, a gesture of political rehabilitation.</p>
            <p>His contributions to physics and the Manhattan Project left an indelible mark on history, raising profound ethical questions that continue to resonate.</p>
